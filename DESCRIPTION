Description: This package is an implementation of a particular phylogenetic comparative method. It can fit univariate among-species Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of phenotypic trait evolution, where the trait evolves toward a primary optimum. Optima can be fitted either as discrete regimes as niches on the phylogenetic tree, and/or with continuous covariates.
